This repository contains Newton’s and Laguerre’s iterative method to solve for Kepler's equation (M=E-esinE). <br>
It also includes the number of iterations required to calculate eccentricity(e) for each method for every pair of Mean anomaly(M) and Eccentric anomaly(E). These comparisons are shown using 3d plot (using MATLAB's built-in function _surf_)
